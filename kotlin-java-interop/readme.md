## Kotlin java interop


### What to keep in mind
- There are some quirks that you will have to solve with automatically generated code
- While kotlin has 100% interop with java you might want to keep interface between kotlin and java fairly small 
- Kotlin is not java. They have a lot of similarities, but they are somewhat different languages.
- You are somewhat tied to intellij if you want to use kotlin.
- Slower build
